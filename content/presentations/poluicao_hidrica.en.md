This presentation was part of the `Fundamentals of Environmental Protection` course in the Military Police Soldier Training Program of Bahia (CFSD-PMBA) in 2025. It addresses the main types of water pollution, their sources, and the impacts on public health and aquatic ecosystems. We also discuss environmental legislation related to the protection of water resources and the responsibilities of public institutions in preventing and controlling pollution. The presentation emphasizes the importance of environmental awareness and sustainable practices for the preservation of water bodies and the promotion of collective health.
