This presentation was part of the `Emotional Health and Quality of Life` discipline in the Soldier Formation Course of the Military Police of Bahia (CFSD-PMBA) in 2025. It addresses the importance of emotional health and quality of life, focusing on the challenges faced by public safety professionals, especially military police officers. We discuss strategies to promote mental well-being, deal with occupational stress, and implement practices that improve the quality of life in the work environment. We also address the relationship between emotional health and professional performance, highlighting the need for institutional policies that support the mental health of military police officers.
