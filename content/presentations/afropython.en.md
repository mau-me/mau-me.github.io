This presentation explores the development of an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system that uses computer vision and LLMs (Language Models) to capture text from license plates obtained through videos. We cover everything from setup, through machine learning and image processing techniques, to integration with multimodal language models to improve recognition accuracy.

This presentation was written in Portuguese and was part of the [afropython 2025 conference](https://afropythonconf.org/), whick took place in July 2025 in Salvador, Brazil.
